##Brown Bread

###Ingredients
- 3 cups (12 oz) of wheat flour
- 1 cup (4 oz) of white flour (do not use self-rising as it already contains baking powder and salt)
- 14oz of buttermilk (pour in a bit at a time until the dough is moist)
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda
- 2oz of butter if you want to deviate a bit

###Method
- Preheat the oven to 425 F. degrees.  Lightly grease and flour a cake pan.  In a large bowl sieve and combine all the dry ingredients. Rub in the butter until the flour is crumbly
- Add the buttermilk to form a sticky dough.  Place on floured surface and lightly knead (too much allows the gas to escape)
- Shape into a round flat shape in a round cake pan and cut a cross in the top of the dough
- Cover the pan with another pan and bake for 30 minutes (this simulates the bastible pot).  Remove cover and bake for an additional 15 minutes
- The bottom of the bread will have a hollow sound when tapped to indicate doneness
- Cover the bread in a tea towel and lightly sprinkle water on the cloth to keep the bread moist
